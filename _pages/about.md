Welcome! I am a second year PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Lausanne (Unil) under the supervision of [Gianluca Benigno](https://sites.google.com/view/gianlucabenigno/home?authuser=0).

My research interests lie in macro finance, I am particularly interested in broker/dealer frictions and NBFI impact in the financial sector and the broad macroeconomy.

I hold an MSc in Economics from the University of Amsterdam, and completed the doctoral program of the [Study Centre Gerzensee](https://szgerzensee.ch/).
